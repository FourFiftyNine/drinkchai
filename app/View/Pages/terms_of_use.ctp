If you choose to create an Account, you agree to provide only accurate, complete registration information, and you will keep that information up-to-date if it changes. When you register, you will obtain unique log-in credentials (a &ldquo;User ID&rdquo;). Access to the DrinkChai Site and Services is not authorized by any other person or entity using your User ID and you are responsible for preventing such unauthorized use. Individuals and entities whose privilege to access the Site or use the Services has previously been terminated by DrinkChai may not register for an Account, nor may you designate any of those individuals to use your Account on your behalf.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">DrinkChai relies on User IDs to know whether users accessing the Site and using our Services are authorized to do so.

You are solely responsible for any and all access to the Site or use of the Services by persons using your User ID.

Deals</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">DrinkChai gives users the abilit &nbsp;to purchase certain products and services (each a &ldquo;Deal,&rdquo; and collectively, &ldquo;Deals&rdquo;) from third-party merchants (each the &ldquo;Merchant&rdquo;). &nbsp;The promotion of each Deal works as a form of advertisement for the Merchant by DrinkChai. By purchasing a deal, you agree to these Terms, the fine print identified in the Deal copy (defined below) and/or any additional deal-specific terms related to the Deal at the time of purchase. These Terms apply to all purchases, unless the Fine Print on a particular purchase states otherwise, and except as otherwise required by law. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and the Fine Print on a deal , the Fine Print will control, except to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</span></p><h3 class="c1"><span class="c0">How It Works</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By placing an order for a given Deal, you are agreeing to purchase the Deal you have selected on the terms, restrictions and conditions associated with the Deal. Once you have placed your order, you will receive a confirmation of the Deal and your credit card or other payment mechanism will be charged for the amount of the Deal. </span><span class="c0">We will notify you by email when your payment has been processed and your shipping information has been passed on to the seller.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;You are required to create an Account in order to purchase any Deal so we can collect information to allow you to pay for your Deals and so we can provide you with easy access to your account so that you can view your past purchases and modify your preferences.</span></p><h3 class="c1"><span class="c0">Refunds</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once the Merchant has delivered the Deal to you, you are allowed to request a refund within 7 days if the Deal is not as described, damaged, or otherwise unsatisfactory. The Refund process must be initiated by the user and the user should directly contact the Merchant. If attempts to contact the Merchant cannot be resolved, please contact us at </span><span class="c0 c7"><a class="c5" href="mailto:team@drinkchai.com">team@drinkchai.com</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and we will do our best to resolve the issue. </span><span class="c0">Ultimately, we want you to be happy. </span></p><h3 class="c1"><span class="c0">Merchant Is The Issuer</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Merchant is the issuer of the Deal and is solely responsible for redeeming the Deal. The Merchant is also solely responsible for all goods and services it provides to you and for any and all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities and costs it may cause you to suffer, directly or indirectly, in full or in part, whether related to the use or redemption of a Deal or not, as well as for any unclaimed property liability arising from unredeemed or partially redeemed Vouchers. Unless otherwise indicated in a Deal or other offer, DrinkChai is solely the marketer of the Merchant&rsquo;s goods or services. You hereby irrevocably waive all rights related to, and release DrinkChai and its subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, officers, directors, employees and agents from, any liabilities arising from or related to any act or omission of a Merchant in connection with your use of a Deal or the products and/or services it provides in connection with it.</span></p><h3 class="c1"><span class="c0">Deal Availability</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some Deals are not available for purchase beyond certain geographical and jurisdictional boundaries. DrinkChai reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to exclude or otherwise limit the provision of a Deal, the Sites, the Services or any other product or service. DrinkChai does not represent or warrant that any product or service promoted on the Site will be available for purchase by any particular person. Some of our Deals are limited in number. Any attempt by you to obtain more than the permitted number specified for a particular Deal, including, without limitation, using multiple or different identities, credit cards, forms, registrations or addresses, will void your purchase and may subject your Account to termination. Whether purchase characteristics constitute an attempt to violate our rules shall be determined at our sole discretion.</span></p><h3 class="c1"><span class="c0">Pricing Information</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We display discounts on our Sites in connection with each Deal. These discounts are calculated based upon certain pricing information provided to us solely by Merchants, which may include the retail price suggested by the manufacturer, supplier or the Merchant, or an estimated price based on standard industry practice. Since the pricing information on which we base our discounts may vary, any discount information that we display may or may not be representative of the prevailing discount in every area or on any particular day.</span></p><h3 class="c1"><span class="c0">Getting Your Deal For Free</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After you buy a Deal, you will receive a personalized link which you may choose to share with your friends. If at least three of your friends buy the same Deal using your personalized link, you will receive your Deal for free (&ldquo;Free Deal&rdquo;)! If your three friends purchase the Deal after we have charged your credit card or other payment mechanism for the purchase of the Deal, we will refund the price of the Deal to the credit card or other payment mechanism you used to purchase the Deal. The opportunity to get a Free Deal may be time-limited and may be subject to other limitations. Any such limitations will be identified in the email you will receive notifying you of your Free Deal. If after you received a Free Deal your friends receive refunds or cancel their purchases, such that less than three people have purchased the deal using your personalized link, you will no longer be eligible for a Free Deal. In such instances, the credit card or other payment mechanism used for this purchase will be charged for the full purchase price of the Deal. In the event payment cannot be processed or authorized, you will be responsible for paying the full purchase price of the Deal.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">You must tell your friends that you are eligible to receive a Free Deal if they buy the applicable Deal using your personalized link. Failure to disclose this information is a violation of this Agreement and may result in the termination of your Account, your disqualification from participating in incentive programs in the future, and/or the forfeiture or the demand for full payment of any Free Deal you received in violation of these Terms.</span></p><h2 class="c1"><span class="c0">7</span><span class="c0">.

Arbitration of Disputes Governed By Arbitration</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Notwithstanding the foregoing, any dispute or claim arising out of or relating in any way to your visit to the Sites, your purchase or redemption of a Voucher or your use of the Services made available through the Sites, these Terms, this Agreement, the Privacy Policy or the validity or enforceability of this arbitration agreement will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except for matters that can be taken to small claims court in your local jurisdiction. This agreement and any arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages) as a court, and must follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent. The arbitration will be conducted before one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving commercial contract disputes from the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA&rsquo;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA&rsquo;s rules are available at http://www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. We will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees for claims totaling less than $10,000. For larger claims, payment of those fees will be governed by the AAA&rsquo;s fee schedule for Consumer Arbitration Costs. You and DrinkChai may be able to recover attorney&rsquo;s fees in arbitration as you/we would in court if they are available under applicable law. For any claim that could otherwise be brought in small claims court, the arbitration shall be conducted solely based on written submissions and, if the arbitrator deems it appropriate, a telephonic hearing. If the claim exceeds what can be recovered in a small claims court, and the arbitrator deems a face-to-face hearing is appropriate, the hearing will be conducted in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location that is convenient to you. A decision by the arbitrator (including any finding of fact and/or conclusion of law) against either you or DrinkChai shall be confidential unless otherwise required to be disclosed by law or by any administrative body and may not be collaterally used by either you or us in existing or subsequent litigation or arbitration involving any other person or DrinkChai customer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement, unauthorized access or trespass to computer networks or any other misuse, misappropriation or theft of intellectual property rights. We also each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. The arbitral tribunal shall have the power to rule on any challenge to its own jurisdiction or to the validity or enforceability of any portion of this agreement to arbitrate. If any part of this arbitration provision is held unenforceable, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the unenforceable provision were not contained. If, however, the class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entire arbitration provision shall be null and void. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial and agree that we shall litigate exclusively in the courts located in Washington, D.C.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Contact information for DrinkChai Registered Agent for Disputes/Arbitration is as follows:</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Corporation Service Company</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">2711 Centerville Road, Suite 400</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wilmington, DE 19808-1645</span></p><h2 class="c1"><span class="c0">17.
