WHAT INFORMATION WILL WE COLLECT?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c4">We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained below. &nbsp;We may use this Personal Information to personalize and improve our services, to allow our users to set up a user account and profile, to contact users, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to analyze how users utilize the Website, and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. We may share certain types of Personal Information with third parties (described in this Section and in Section III below). &nbsp;We collect the following types of information:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A. Information You Provide to Us: </span><span class="c5 c4">We receive and store any information you provide to us. &nbsp;For example, we collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, shipping and billing information, and third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for Facebook or other third party sites). If you provide your third-party account credentials to us, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (&ldquo;Third Party Account Information&rdquo;) may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Website is covered by this Privacy Policy. &nbsp;You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features. &nbsp;We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you cannot be individually identified, and provide that information to our partners. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">B. Information Collected Automatically:</span></p><p class="c3 c11"><span class="c5 c4">Whenever you interact with our Website, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; information, and the page you requested. &ldquo;Cookies&rdquo; are identifiers we transfer to your computer or mobile device that allow us to recognize your browser or mobile device and tell us how and when pages in our Website are visited and by how many people. &nbsp;You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or mobile device to prevent or limit your computer or device&rsquo;s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our Website&rsquo;s features. &nbsp;Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your computer or device, when you click on ads that appear on our site. &nbsp;This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. When we collect usage information (such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to the Website), we only use this data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. &nbsp;For example, this aggregate data tells us how often users use parts of the Website, so that we can make the Website appealing to as many users as possible. &nbsp;We may also provide this aggregate information to our partners; our partners may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Website, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal experience. We never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">C. E-mail and Other Communications: </span><span class="c5 c4">We may contact you, by email or other means; for example, we may send you promotional offers on behalf of other businesses, or communicate with you about your use of the Website. &nbsp;Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make emails more interesting and improve our service. &nbsp;If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please indicate your preference by changing your account settings accordingly, or by clicking &ldquo;unsubscribe&rdquo; in any email we send to you.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5 c4">III. WILL WE SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION WE RECEIVE?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c4">We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. &nbsp;We share your Personal Information in a non-personally identifiable form with third parties as described below.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A. Advertisers:</span><span class="c5 c4">&nbsp;We allow advertisers and/or merchant partners (&ldquo;Advertisers&rdquo;) to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers and you agree that we may provide any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or offers. For example, we might use the fact you purchased green tea from a certain merchant to send or display to you ads or offers for other offerings from that merchant, but we will not tell such merchant who you are.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">B. Affiliated Businesses and Third Party Websites We Do Not Control:</span><span class="c5 c4">&nbsp;In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we&rsquo;re affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the Website (either alone or jointly with us). &nbsp;You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. &nbsp;For example, if you purchase a teapot through the Website, we provide the Tea company your name and shipping address so that the Tea company can ship you the product. &nbsp;Another such service may include the ability for you to choose to automatically transmit Third Party Account Information to your Website profile or to automatically transmit information in your Website profile to your third party account. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to allow these automatic transmissions, please review all third party websites&rsquo; policies.</span><span class="c5 c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">C. Agents:</span><span class="c5 c4">&nbsp;We may employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. &nbsp; &nbsp;Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">D. User Profiles and Submissions:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span><span class="c5 c4">Certain user profile information, including without limitation a user&rsquo;s name, location, and any image content that such user has uploaded to the Website, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Website or address your request for Company&rsquo;s services. &nbsp;Your account privacy settings (if applicable) allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to others. &nbsp;Any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by others. &nbsp;Your user name may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages or comments or upload images or videos through the Website and other users can contact you through messages and comments. &nbsp;A Merchant may also contact you regarding products you have purchased and/or returned using our Website or to broadly communicate a message to its customers who use the Roozt website. &nbsp;Additionally, if you sign into the Website through a third party social networking site or service, your list of &ldquo;friends&rdquo; from that site or service may be automatically imported to the Website, and such &ldquo;friends,&rdquo; if they are also registered users of the Website, may be able to access certain non-public information you have entered in your Website user profile. &nbsp;Again, we do not control the policies and practices of any other third party site or service.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">E. Business Transfers:</span><span class="c5 c4">&nbsp;We may choose to buy or sell assets. &nbsp;In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. &nbsp;Also, if we (or substantially all of our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, Personal Information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">F. Protection of DrinkChai and Others:</span><span class="c5 c4">&nbsp;We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of DrinkChai, our employees, our users, or others. &nbsp;This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">G. With Your Consent:</span><span class="c5 c4">&nbsp;Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c5 c4">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">IV. IS PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT ME SECURE?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c4">Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. &nbsp;If you access your account via a third party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that third party site or service. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c5 c4">We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but we cannot guarantee complete security.
